Style guide
===========

-  Use lowercase filenames, including ``email_templates/`` files.

In Python code and documentation:

-  Use "lender", not "FI" or "financial institution".
-  Use "borrower", not "MSME", "SME" or "small and medium-sized enterprises".
-  Use "administrator" or "admin", not "OCP".

.. note::

   Some endpoints and enums cannot be made to conform to this style guide, without migrating the database or updating the frontend.
