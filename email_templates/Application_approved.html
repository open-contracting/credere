        <p>Hi {{AWARD_SUPPLIER_NAME}}, </p>

      <div class='action main_content_item'>
        <p>
          Thank you for making a credit application to {{LENDER_NAME}} for working capital for the {{TENDER_TITLE}} public sector
          contract with {{BUYER_NAME}}.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='action main_content_item'>
        <p>
          All of the bankâ€™s compliance checks have been completed and your credit has been prequalified.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='action main_content_item'>
        <p>
          The next step is for you to get your contract with {{BUYER_NAME}} signed and to upload the contract in Credere
          so that the credit provider can approve the credit.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='action main_content_item'>
        <p>
          Note that if the contract value is different from the award value, the credit amount offered by the credit
          provider may be different.
        </p>
